ksmbd has too much code for it all to fit in your context window in one go.
Therefore you are going to audit each SMB command in turn. Commands are
handled by the __process_request function from server.c, which selects a
command from the conn->cmds list and calls it. We are currently auditing the
smb2_sess_setup command. The code context you have been given includes all of
the work setup code code up to the __process_request function, the
smb2_sess_setup function and a breadth first expansion of smb2_sess_setup up
to a depth of 3 function calls.
